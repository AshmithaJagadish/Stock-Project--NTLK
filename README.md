# 📊 StockGPT: AI-Powered Financial Forecasting and Sentiment Analysis Framework

**StockGPT** is a research-grade platform for integrated **stock market forecasting**, **technical analysis**, and **news sentiment extraction** using **machine learning**, **natural language processing (NLP)**, and **financial time series modeling**.

Developed as a modular and extensible framework, StockGPT serves as a robust experimentation and evaluation environment for financial data scientists, quants, and researchers seeking to bridge the gap between market data and intelligent investment strategies.

## 🧠 Core Capabilities

### 🔍 Data Ingestion & Preprocessing
- Retrieves historical stock data via [Yahoo Finance API](https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/)
- Flattens and cleanses data for modeling
- Computes technical indicators:
  - **RSI (Relative Strength Index)**
  - **MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)**
  - **Moving Averages**
  - **Rolling Volatility**

### 📈 Forecasting Engine
Three forecast models are implemented with tunable parameters:
- **Facebook Prophet**
- **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)**
- **LSTM Neural Networks** via TensorFlow/Keras

Each model is independently tunable and benchmarked using **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** for automatic model selection.

### 📰 NLP & Sentiment Analysis
- Real-time financial news fetched via **NewsAPI**
- Summarized using **TextRank** algorithm (Sumy)
- Sentiment scored using **VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary & sEntiment Reasoner)** from NLTK
- Aggregated sentiment score is factored into forecast adjustments (+/- 5% correction)

### 📊 Visualization and UI
- **Streamlit** front-end
- Modular tabs:
  - Company Overview
  - Historical & Technical Charting
  - Multi-Model Forecast Visualization
  - News Sentiment Breakdown
  - Comparative Analysis (side-by-side)
  - Insights & Recommendations
  - Raw Data & Custom Settings
